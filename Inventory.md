1) Load and save(serialize and deserialize) tables to files
2) Create the GUI

4) Figure out how to write stored procedures(SQL) and retrieve their results for querying the database with the GUI
5) Load movie files into according tables and save them for later usage
    * Need to determine how we want to organize the tables, so probably do pseudo code for queries first
